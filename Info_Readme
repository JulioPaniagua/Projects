Kunai Ninja project was designed and programmed by me but I used internet art.
Its Bug Season was programmed by me, except shaders, art and some graphic elements. The art was created by my colleague Artem Anikin. 
We designed together the game for an Itch.io Jam and we placed 27th from over 500 games submitted. 
I have done more projects during my university time (which code doesn´t represent my actual level, so I didn´t upload them),
including a free game with 10.000 downloads in Steam, "Cyberplug" which gameplay I programmed by myself with some support from my team for specific tasks.
I can´t include the code here since the videogame its not only mine.
Everything was made in Unity.
